# ticket-management-system
A ticket management system made with Python, MongoDB, HTML/CSS/JS.

## How to use
Using the template provided in templates/tickets make your ticket or edit the templates provided just leave the {{id}}. Save that file as an SVG and open the SVG in a text editor, copy the code from the text editor and paste it and replace the SVG element with the copied code. Run a MongoDB server on port 27017 or make your own server and paste the server link into the connection_id. It should work now!
